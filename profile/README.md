  <p>I’m Max. I make random stuff but I’m not really ever committed to anything I make, really. I’m from the UK. I can’t spell nowt. Despite my commit history, I do actually have a life and don’t spend my whole life on this app.</p>

  <p>I code on a Mac but also use Windows sorta or something like that. Used Linux at one point, and all my servers run on it. I say that like I have tonnes of servers, but really I don’t. They run Ubuntu. I 3D print all sorts of stuff, mainly things in 3D yk, but like most of the time it just makes spaghetti. But that’s alright, ’cause I like spaghetti and I get hungry sometimes.</p>

  <p>IRL I swim competitively - see, I do have a life off this screen. I do a little bit of sim racing, but I’m not really any good at it, even though I enjoy it. I 3D print all the stuff to go with it, like custom wheels and shifters and stuff.</p>

  <p>Do you think I can use this as a job application.. Probably not. But maybe. If you’re seeing this: please hire me. I like cars - I think my favourite would have to be the Porsche GT3 RS. But tbh I like most cars (other than Lamborghinis 🤮 — but I’d take one for free if you’re offering).</p>

  <p>If you want to tell me I’m bad at coding, just stfu. Like, no one asked you. If I’m trying to contribute to your repo, just accept the pull request already. I just like my pfp being on the front page of the repo — be a bit sympathetic please. If I spelt anything wrong, then sucks to be you.</p>

  <p>I spend about 25 hours a day on TikTok.</p>

  <p>Straight. 6ft 1, 16 as of when I’m writing this — if you really care, check the commit date, you lazy arse. I spend 24/7 talking to ChatGPT. Actually love my friends 💙. Got into the neeky coding stuff when I started playing Minecraft and wanted to make my own server and needed plugins. Don’t really play computer games anymore, other than driving games. Sometimes GTA V — gotta get those gold medals in all the story mode missions.</p>

  <p>I try to build my own businesses, but it never really works. Just check my GitHub organisations — most of them will be private repos, but you get the point.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">Right, time to paste this into ChatGPT to fix my spellings. Gonna be tough to get it to keep my sarcastic manner. Good luck in life ❤️.</p>
