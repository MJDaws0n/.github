  <p>I’m Max. I make random stuff but I’m not really ever committed to anything I make, really. I’m from the UK. I can’t spell nowt. Despite my commit history, I do actually have a life and don’t spend my whole life on this app.</p>

  <p>I code on a Mac but also use Windows sorta. Used Linux at one point. I 3D print all sorts of stuff.</p>

  <p>IRL I swim competitively. I do a little bit of sim racing, but I’m not really any good at it, even though I enjoy it. I 3D print all the stuff to go with it, like custom wheels and shifters and stuff.</p>

  <p>6ft 1, 17 as of when I’m writing this. Got into the coding stuff when I started playing Minecraft and wanted to make my own server and needed plugins. Don’t really play computer games very often anymore.</p>

  <p>I try to build my own businesses, but it never really works. Just check my GitHub organisations — most of them will be private repos, but you get the point.</p>
