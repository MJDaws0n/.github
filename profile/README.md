    I’m Max. I make random stuff but I’m not really ever committed to anything I make, really. I’m from the UK. I can’t spell nowt. Despite my commit history, I do actually have a life and don’t spend my whole life on this app. Yes, I do have GitHub Mobile, but at least I don’t use Discord (only ‘cause bro won’t hop on 😡).

    I code on a Mac but also use Windows sorta or something like that. Used Linux at one point, and all my servers run on it. I say that like I have tonnes of servers, but really I don’t. They run Ubuntu. I 3D print all sorts of stuff, mainly things in 3D yk, but like most of the time it just makes spaghetti. But that’s alright, ’cause I like spaghetti and I get hungry sometimes.

    IRL I swim competitively — see, I do have a life off this screen. It’s like 1:59 AM right now I think. I do a little bit of sim racing, but I’m not really any good at it, even though I enjoy it. I 3D print all the stuff to go with it, like custom wheels and shifters and stuff. Thinking I’m gonna write this, then get ChatGPT to format it nice. Idk, I haven’t decided yet.

    Do you think I can use this as a job application.. Probably not. But maybe. If you’re seeing this: please hire me. <strong>Pweeettyyy pweeeaasssee.</strong>

    I like cars — I think my favourite would have to be the Porsche GT3 RS. But tbh I like most cars (other than Lamborghinis 🤮 — but I’d take one for free if you’re offering).

    If you want to tell me I’m bad at coding, just stfu. Like, no one asked you. If I’m trying to contribute to your repo, just accept the pull request already. I just like my face being on the front page — be a bit sympathetic please. If I spelt anything wrong, then sucks to be you.

    I spend about 25 hours a day on TikTok. I like that one film called <strong>UP</strong> — y’know, that one with the man and the balloons — just because the fact it’s an extended metaphor. I like metaphors. Especially when it comes to fishing, if you get what I’m saying. 6ft 1 btw.

    Straight. 16 as of when I’m writing this — if you really care, check the commit date, you lazy arse. I spend 24/7 talking to ChatGPT. Actually love my friends 💙. Got into the neeky coding stuff when I started playing Minecraft and wanted to make my own server and needed plugins. Don’t really play computer games anymore, other than driving games. Sometimes GTA V — gotta get those gold medals in all the story mode missions.

    I try to build my own businesses, but it never really works. Just check my GitHub organisations — most of them will be private repos, but you get the point.

    Right, time to paste this into ChatGPT to fix my spellings. Gonna be tough to get it to keep my sarcastic manner. Good luck in life my brother ❤️. Or sister.
