  <p>I’m Max. I make random stuff but I’m not really ever committed to anything I make, really. I’m from the UK. I can’t spell nowt. Despite my commit history, I do actually have a life and don’t spend my whole life on this app.</p>

  <p>17 as of when I’m writing this. Got into the coding stuff when I started playing Minecraft and wanted to make my own server and needed plugins. Don’t really play computer games very often anymore.</p>
